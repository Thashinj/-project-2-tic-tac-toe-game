Project 2 - Tic Tac Toe Game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

In this project, I have created a Tic Tac Toe Game that allows 2 players to insert X or O in the game grid. After a game ends, if a player wins the games when they place X's or O's in a single row, column or diagonal, it displays the winning player's message below the game. If no player wins the game, a 'Tied!' message will be displayed.

# Features & How to Use

Game Grid:

Two people can play as Player 1 and Player 2 respectively. Player 1 inserts 'X' anywhere in the game grid. Then Player 2 inserts 'O' after Player 1 does. They will repeatedly insert their symbols across the grid to win the game. The player's turn message will be displayed below the game board when they are playing. For the players to win the game, the X's or O's should be in a continuous row, column or a diagonal.

Display Result Message:

If the player fulfills the winning conditions, they win the game. The message 'Game over! X wins!' or 'Game over! O wins!' will be displayed below the board depending on which player won. If none of the two players win, the message 'Tied!' will be displayed then.

New Game Button:

After a game ends with a tie or one of the players winning, you can click on the 'New Game' button to reset the game for a new round. The game grid will erase all the X's and O's added in the previous game.
